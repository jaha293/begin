      <span itemtype="agent">Shelley Lebreque</span> from lovetoknow.com states that <span itemtype="instrument">Firewalls</span> are a great place to start with computer safety.
      "If you connect to the internet, you should always run a firewall. A firewall can block outside communication
     if you haven't authorized it and even stop data from entering or leaving the computer without your permission.
      There are both <span itemtype="instrument">hardware</span> and <span itemtype="instrument">software</span> firewalls, and you can run both at the same time.
     Software firewalls often come as part of an operating system. For example, Windows includes one,
    and you should always have it on unless you decide to get your own. As with any software, you can
     shop around for a commercial firewall that is configured with the features that are most important to you.
    You can buy a hardware firewall as a stand-alone product, or they are also often included in broadband routers.
     A router is good to have as another layer of <spaan itemtype="result">protection</span>; your computer can sit behind it and make it even harder
      for hackers to get to it. Ensure you use a high-quality firewall and configure it properly by changing all default passwords."

      <h1>Security Statistics</h1>
      <p>In order to better understand how important computer security really is, here are 5 statistics from Steve Morgan
        with CSO:
        <br></br>
        1. <b>Cyber crime damage costs to hit $6 trillion annually by 2021. </b> It all begins and ends with cyber crime. Without
         it, there's nothing to cyber-defend. The cybersecurity community and major media have largely concurred on the prediction
          that cyber crime damages will cost the world $6 trillion annually by 2021, up from $3 trillion just a year ago. This represents
           the greatest transfer of economic wealth in history, risks the incentives for innovation and investment, and will be more profitable
            than the global trade of all major illegal drugs combined.
            <br><br>
      2. <b>Cybersecurity spending to exceed $1 trillion from 2017 to 2021.</b> The rising tide of cyber crime has pushed information
       security (a subset of cybersecurity) spending to more than $86.4 billion in 2017, according to Gartner. That doesn't include
        an accounting of internet of things (IoT), industrial IoT, and industrial control systems (ICS) security, automotive security,
         and other cybersecurity categories. Global spending on cybersecurity products and services are predicted to exceed $1 trillion
          over the next five years, from 2017 to 2021.
          <br></br>
     3. <b>Cyber crime will more than triple the number of unfilled cybersecurity jobs, which is predicted to reach 3.5 million by 2021.</b> Every
      IT position is also a cybersecurity position now. Every IT worker, every technology worker, needs to be involved with protecting and defending
    apps, data, devices, infrastructure and people. The cybersecurity workforce shortage is even worse than what the jobs numbers suggest. As a result,
     the cybersecurity unemployment rate has dropped to zero percent.
      <br></br>
      4. <b>Human attack surface to reach 6 billion people by 2022.</b> As the world goes digital, humans have moved ahead of machines as the top target for
     cyber criminals. There are 3.8 billion internet users in 2017 (51 percent of the world’s population of 7 billion), up from 2 billion in 2015.
      Cybersecurity Ventures predicts there will be 6 billion internet users by 2022 (75 percent of the projected world population of 8 billion) —
      and more than 7.5 billion internet users by 2030 (90 percent of the projected world population of 8.5 million, 6 years of age and older).
      The hackers smell blood now, not silicon.
     <br></br>
     5. <b>Global ransomware damage costs are predicted to exceed $5 billion in 2017.</b> That's up from $325 million in 2015—a 15X increase in two years,
      and expected to worsen. Ransomware attacks on healthcare organizations—the No. 1 cyber-attacked industry—will quadruple by 2020. Cybersecurity
       Ventures predicts that a business will fall victim to a ransomware attack every 14 seconds by 2019.
